# Docker Workout

getting-started is a JS application which is an official docker image from docker hub repo [link to repo](https://hub.docker.com/r/docker/getting-started).

WSL-StopPrcess.txt has this command WSL --shutdown to terminate the WSL deamon running in the background even after docker is closed.

docker.md is a reference file which i created while exploring docker for my own reference. This could be useful for buiginners starting out with docker.
